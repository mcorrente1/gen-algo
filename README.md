# gen-algo
The best way to learn anything is by doing, so I have created this repository to work on a program that utilizes a genetic algorithm.

## Genetic Algorithms
Genetic algorithms are heavily inspired by biology and fall under the category of evolutionairy programming.  Esssentialy, there is a goal (in this case a sequence of characters) that the program attempts to reach through a process similar to how biological evolution works: by generating populations from primarily the most fit solutions of a previously generated population through an iterative process of crossovers and mutations until the goal is reached.

## Scope
Initially, this program will be built to utilize a genetic algorithm to generate a string of 1's of a user defined sized.  As time progresses and this goal is achieved, I hope to expand on the knowledge gained throughout this project and create a much more dynamic program that is able to solve more complex problems through the use of genetic programming.
